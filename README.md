# Slot_Machine Project


"Slot Machine Simulator" is a Python program that simulates the experience of playing a classic slot machine game. Players can deposit funds, choose the number of lines to bet on, and set their bet amount per line. The slot machine spins, generating random symbol combinations, and the player wins or loses based on matching symbols and bet amounts. With interactive prompts and clear visual representation of the slot machine, this program offers an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.
